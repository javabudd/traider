# traider

A hub for using an AI CLI (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cowork, Gemini CLI,
Cursor, Aider, …) to gain financial insights and help make trading
decisions.

`traider` itself doesn't trade. It's **one MCP server** that exposes
read-only market data, account data, macro, fundamentals, and
analytics as tools the model can call. You keep every decision; the
model fetches, compiles, parses, and explains.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the hub's north star — what belongs
here, what doesn't, and how to navigate the per-connector docs.

```

Each connector under `src/traider/connectors/` is a module with its
own `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`. Connector modules are loaded
**lazily** — only the ones listed in `TRAIDER_TOOLS` are imported,
so you don't pay the dep-load or warmup cost for groups you aren't
using.

## Selecting which tool groups to load

One env var, `TRAIDER_TOOLS`, controls the exposed tool surface:

```
TRAIDER_TOOLS=schwab,fred,fed-calendar,sec-edgar,factor,treasury,news
```

| Profile        | Tool group                        | Creds required                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `schwab`       | Schwab market data + accounts     | Schwab app key/secret + OAuth   |
| `yahoo`        | Yahoo Finance market data         | None                            |
| `fred`         | FRED macro / release calendar     | `FRED_API_KEY` (free)           |
| `fed-calendar` | FOMC meeting calendar             | None                            |
| `sec-edgar`    | SEC filings, insiders, 13F, XBRL  | `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` (yours)  |
| `factor`       | Ken French factors + industries   | None                            |
| `treasury`     | Treasury auctions, DTS, debt      | None                            |
| `news`         | Massive news + sentiment          | `MASSIVE_API_KEY` (free tier)   |

Rules:

- **Pick at most one market-data backend** (`schwab` *or* `yahoo`).
  They expose the same tool names and are mutually exclusive; enabling
  both at once is a startup error.
- **Add any mix of the other profiles.** They expose distinct tool
  names, so they compose freely with each other and with whichever
  market-data backend you chose.

If `TRAIDER_TOOLS` is empty, the server starts with no tools
registered — useful for smoke-testing the transport but not for
actual work.

### Choosing a market-data backend

`schwab` and `yahoo` expose the **same tool names** (`get_quote`,
`get_price_history`, `run_technical_analysis`, `analyze_*`, …) so
prompts are portable. They differ only in where the data comes from
and what's not available:

|                              | `schwab`                                    | `yahoo`                                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Account needed               | Schwab developer account (app approval)     | None                                         |
| Auth flow                    | One-time OAuth (browser)                    | None                                         |
| Brokerage (`get_accounts`)   | ✅ real positions, cost basis, P&L          | ❌ raises — no brokerage                      |
| Market hours (`get_market_hours`) | ✅ authoritative, holiday-aware        | ❌ raises — Yahoo has no such endpoint        |
| Movers                       | per-index (`$SPX`, `$DJI`, …)               | US-market-wide Yahoo screeners               |
| Option chains                | ✅ Greeks, strategy previews, real-time     | ⚠️ delayed ~15min, no Greeks, `SINGLE` only  |
| Intraday history depth       | Long (years of minute bars)                 | Short (~7d for 1m, ~60d for sub-hourly)      |
| Data freshness               | Real-time during RTH (Schwab entitlement)   | Typically delayed ~15 min                    |
| Unofficial endpoint?         | No — stable, paid, documented API           | Yes — `yfinance` scrapes; expect drift       |

## Quickstart

1. **Configure credentials** in `.env`.
2. **Run the server** — with [Docker](#run-with-docker-recommended)
   (recommended) or [directly on the host](#run-on-the-host-alternative).
3. **[Wire the server into your AI CLI](#connect-your-ai-cli).**

### Configure credentials

Copy the template and edit:

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

Set `TRAIDER_TOOLS` to the tool groups you want, plus credentials
for the profiles that need them:

```
TRAIDER_TOOLS=schwab,fred,fed-calendar,sec-edgar

# schwab profile only.
SCHWAB_APP_KEY=...
SCHWAB_APP_SECRET=...
SCHWAB_CALLBACK_URL=https://127.0.0.1

# fred profile only.
FRED_API_KEY=...

# sec-edgar profile only.
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=your-name you@example.com
```

The `yahoo`, `fed-calendar`, `factor`, and `treasury` profiles need no
credentials. Never commit `.env` or paste its contents into logs or
chat.

### Run with Docker (recommended)

One image, one service, one port. You skip installing conda + the
TA-Lib C library on your host.

```bash
# Build once (or after a Dockerfile / pyproject.toml change):
docker compose build

# (Schwab profile only) one-time interactive OAuth:
docker compose run --rm traider traider auth schwab

# Start the server:
docker compose up -d
```

The MCP endpoint is exposed at `http://localhost:8765/mcp`. Per-
connector log files land in `./logs/` on the host
(`schwab.log`, `fred.log`, …) plus an aggregated `traider.log`.

Switch profile mix: edit `TRAIDER_TOOLS` in `.env`, then
`docker compose restart`. No rebuild needed unless deps changed.

### Run on the host (alternative)

No Docker. Use a conda env because TA-Lib needs the native C library.

```bash
conda create -n traider -c conda-forge -y python=3.13 ta-lib
conda activate traider
pip install -e .

# Schwab-only: one-time browser OAuth.
traider auth schwab

# Start the server (profiles come from $TRAIDER_TOOLS).
traider --transport streamable-http --port 8765
# or stdio:
traider --transport stdio
```

## Connect your AI CLI

The server exposes a single MCP endpoint. Register it once; the tools
available are whatever profiles you enabled in `TRAIDER_TOOLS`.

### Claude Code

```bash
# HTTP (Docker, or any streamable-http run):
claude mcp add --transport http traider http://localhost:8765/mcp

# Stdio (host install):
claude mcp add --transport stdio traider -- traider --transport stdio
```

Add `--scope user` for cross-project or `--scope project` to check it
into `.mcp.json`. Verify with `claude mcp list`.

### OpenCode

`opencode.json` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
(user):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "traider": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://localhost:8765/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Stdio variant: `"type": "local", "command": ["traider", "--transport", "stdio"]`.

### Gemini CLI

`.gemini/settings.json` (project) or `~/.gemini/settings.json` (user):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "traider": {
      "httpUrl": "http://localhost:8765/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Stdio variant: `"command": "traider", "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]`.
Gemini CLI does not auto-load `.env` — export vars in your shell or
list them under `"env"` in the server entry.

## What this hub will and won't do

- **Will.** Fetch, align, and compute on market data. Explain what
  the numbers say. Flag regime shifts, correlations, mean-reversion
  setups, realized-vol outliers, fundamental outliers — all of it
  read-only, all of it for the user to act on.
- **Won't.** Place orders, create alerts, make writes to any
  brokerage or external service. Ship "auto-trader" features.
  Silently retry past a 429 or paper over a failing dependency.
  Store credentials in the repo or in logs.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full set of hub-wide constraints
(which every connector module inherits).
