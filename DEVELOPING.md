# DEVELOPING.md — traider

Developer overlay for `traider`. For runtime / analyst
guidance — the docs that get loaded into an AI CLI's context — see

## Environment setup

**All Python commands in this repo run inside a conda env named
`traider`.** TA-Lib has a C dependency; conda-forge is the supported
install path and the Docker image uses the same recipe.

```bash
conda create -n traider -c conda-forge -y python=3.13 ta-lib
conda activate traider
pip install -e .
```

`pyproject.toml` declares every provider's deps at the top level —
`yfinance`, `lxml`, `beautifulsoup4`, `numpy`, `TA-Lib`, `mcp`, `httpx`,
`python-dotenv`. They're installed unconditionally; which of them
actually get *imported* is decided at runtime by the provider loader.

Each provider is **self-contained under its directory** — imports
inside a provider are relative (`from .client import X`, `from ..
logging_utils import …`). Providers don't import from each other.
`ta.py` / `analytics.py` duplicate between `schwab/` and `yahoo/`
intentionally; merging them into a shared module would couple the two
market-data backends in a way the provider system is designed to avoid.

## How the provider system works

One server, many providers. `TRAIDER_PROVIDERS` (comma-separated in
`.env` or the process env) lists the providers to load:

```
TRAIDER_PROVIDERS=schwab,fred,sec-edgar,factor,treasury,news
```

Startup flow, in `src/traider/server.py`:

1. `load_settings()` reads `TRAIDER_PROVIDERS` and `TRAIDER_LOG_DIR`
   into a frozen `TraiderSettings`.
2. `_validate_providers(...)` rejects unknown names and enforces the
   `schwab` / `yahoo` mutex.
3. `_build_mcp()` creates one `FastMCP("traider", …)` instance.
4. `load_providers(mcp, settings)` walks the provider list and calls
   `importlib.import_module(PROVIDERS[name])` — this is where lazy
   loading happens. `yfinance`, `TA-Lib`, `lxml`, etc. only get
   imported for providers that are enabled.
5. For each loaded module, `module.register(mcp, settings)` is called
   to hang `@mcp.tool()` functions on the shared FastMCP.
6. `mcp.run(transport=…)` starts the transport loop.

`schwab` and `yahoo` are listed in `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDERS`; enabling
both is a `SystemExit` at startup rather than a race on the shared
tool names.

### The register contract

Every provider's `tools.py` exposes:

```python
def register(mcp: FastMCP, settings: TraiderSettings) -> None:
    attach_provider_logger("traider.<name>", settings.log_file("<name>"))

    @mcp.tool()
    def some_tool(...): ...
    @mcp.tool()
    def other_tool(...): ...
```

Module-level state (client singletons, caches) lives at module scope;
`register()` is called once at startup. Tool functions close over the
module's `_get_client()` / config and capture the `mcp` instance
through the decorator.

## Running locally

```bash
conda activate traider
pip install -e .

export TRAIDER_PROVIDERS=schwab,fred,sec-edgar
export SCHWAB_APP_KEY=...          # if TRAIDER_PROVIDERS includes schwab
export SCHWAB_APP_SECRET=...
export SCHWAB_CALLBACK_URL=https://127.0.0.1
export FRED_API_KEY=...            # if TRAIDER_PROVIDERS includes fred
export SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT="your-name you@example.com"   # if sec-edgar

# Schwab-only: one-time interactive OAuth. Writes to
# ~/.schwab-connector/schwab-token.json (or $SCHWAB_TOKEN_FILE).
traider auth schwab

# Then the server:
traider                                          # streamable-http on 8765
traider --transport stdio                        # for direct CLI wiring
traider --transport streamable-http --port 9000  # custom port
```

`python -m traider` is equivalent to `traider`.

### Docker

`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root build a single
image that carries every dep (conda ta-lib + all pip deps). The
service entry reads `TRAIDER_PROVIDERS` from `.env` and exposes 8765.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm traider auth schwab   # schwab only
docker compose up -d
```

Volume mounts:

- `${HOME}/.schwab-connector:/tokens` — Schwab OAuth token file.
- `./logs:/app/logs` — per-provider log files (host-visible).
- `${HOME}/.cache/traider-factor:/cache` — Ken French ZIP cache.

## Logging

Two layers:

- **Root aggregate log**: `<TRAIDER_LOG_DIR>/traider.log` (default
  `./logs/traider.log`). Captures the `traider`, `mcp`, `uvicorn*`,
  and `httpx` loggers.
- **Per-provider logs**: `<TRAIDER_LOG_DIR>/<name>.log` (e.g.
  `logs/schwab.log`, `logs/fred.log`). Each provider's `register()`
  calls `attach_provider_logger("traider.<name>", settings.log_file("<name>"))`.

Rotation: 5 MB × 3 backups on every handler. Tool handlers wrap their
bodies in `logger.exception(...)`, so the full traceback for a failed
tool call lands in the relevant per-provider log. **When a tool
call fails, read the log file before asking the user for the
traceback** — MCP transports often hide stdout/stderr from the agent
calling tools.

## Adding a new provider

Mirror an existing small one (e.g. `news/` or `treasury/`):

```
src/traider/providers/<name>/
├── __init__.py          # one-line module docstring
├── tools.py             # def register(mcp, settings)
└── <client>.py          # thin httpx wrapper (or scraper, or parser)
```

Then:

1. **Add the provider** to `PROVIDERS` in `src/traider/server.py`.
2. **Add any new deps** to the top-level `pyproject.toml`
   (`dependencies = [...]`) — but keep the heavy imports inside
   `tools.py` so unused providers don't pay the load cost.
3. **Add env-var docs** to `.env.dist`.
4. **Link from root docs**: row in the provider table in `README.md`
   and `AGENTS.md`, plus a section in this file's
   [per-provider dev notes](#per-provider-dev-notes).

Conventions shared across providers:

- Clients are thin (one method per upstream endpoint). JSON comes
  back essentially unchanged so the model sees the raw shape.
- Tool docstrings are where the guidance for the model lives — pick
  of parameters, period formats, gotchas. Keep them detailed; the
  model reads them through MCP.
- Raise on 429 / upstream errors. No silent retry-loop fallbacks.
- Every response that hits an upstream should include a `source` URL
  and `fetched_at` timestamp if the upstream doesn't already provide
  one, so the analyst can cite it.

## Per-provider dev notes

Each subsection captures the dev-oriented content from the provider's
original per-server AGENTS.md: internals, secrets, gotchas, and "what
not to do." Runtime analyst guidance lives in the root
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### schwab

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to the Schwab Trader API. Quotes,
OHLCV history, TA-Lib indicators, option chains (with Greeks), movers,
market hours, accounts, and pure-numpy analytics. Pure Python over
HTTP — no COM, no desktop app.

**Secrets.** `SCHWAB_APP_KEY`, `SCHWAB_APP_SECRET`,
`SCHWAB_CALLBACK_URL` (must match the app registration in Schwab's
developer portal). Tokens persist to the file at `SCHWAB_TOKEN_FILE`
(default `~/.schwab-connector/schwab-token.json`, mode 0600).
`SchwabClient` auto-refreshes the access token; if the refresh token
itself is dead, it raises `SchwabAuthError` and the user must re-run
`traider auth schwab`.

**Why not the TOS RTD path anymore.** The repo originally tried to
reach TOS Desktop's RTD COM server (`Tos.RTD`, the interface behind
Excel's `=RTD("tos.rtd",…)` formulas). That path is abandoned. The
blocking issue: `IRTDUpdateEvent` is a dual COM interface, and
pywin32 can only synthesize a real vtable for a dual interface from a
registered type library (Office's `MSO.DLL` ships it; plain Windows
does not). Without that TLB, every call path into our Python callback
eventually hits undefined vtable memory and `Py_FatalError`s the
process. Investigating that took a lot of time — don't re-open it
without (a) Office installed and (b) a plan to use
`win32com.universal.RegisterInterfaces`.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Token expiry.** Schwab access tokens expire in ~30 minutes and
  refresh tokens in ~7 days. After a lapse, the user has to re-run
  `traider auth schwab`. Don't silently swallow "invalid refresh
  token" — surface it.
- **`currentDayProfitLoss` is not day P&L on same-day opens.** The
  field in `get_accounts` positions equals `marketValue` for any
  position opened today (detectable via
  `previousSessionLongQuantity` / `previousSessionShortQuantity` of
  `0`, or non-zero `currentDayCost`). For same-day opens the
  correct open P&L is in `longOpenProfitLoss` / `shortOpenProfitLoss`.
  The `get_accounts` tool docstring carries the full warning — it
  is load-bearing guidance for any consuming LLM, not just a dev
  note. If you refactor the tool, preserve it.
- **Options symbology.** Schwab expects the 21-character OSI format
  (e.g. `SPY   250321C00500000`), not dotted TOS notation. Equities
  and futures (`/ES`) work as-is.
- **Index symbology on `/quotes` — `$PREFIX`, no `.X`, no `^`.**
  Indices and CBOE yield products need a `$` prefix: `$VIX`, `$SPX`,
  `$NDX`, `$DJI`, `$RUT`, `$COMPX`, `$XSP`, `$VVIX`, `$VXN`, `$TNX`
  / `$TYX` / `$IRX` / `$FVX`. The `.X` suffix and `^` prefix (ToS /
  Yahoo conventions) both return empty strings; so does the bare
  root (`VIX`). Non-CBOE indices (ICE `$DXY`, index-option roots
  like `$SPXW`) don't resolve. Miss mode is a silent empty
  `result`, not an HTTP error — callers can't distinguish wrong
  symbol, wrong convention, and closed market. The full rule (with
  the 10× quirk for CBOE yield products) lives in the `get_quote`
  docstring; keep that authoritative if you refactor.
- **Option chains are nested maps, not lists.** `get_option_chain`
  returns Schwab's native `callExpDateMap` / `putExpDateMap` keyed by
  `"YYYY-MM-DD:dte"` → strike → **list** of contracts (Schwab allows
  multiple strategy legs per strike). When flattening for analysis,
  iterate the list; don't assume length 1 even for `strategy=SINGLE`.
- **`strategy` overrides are load-bearing.** `ANALYTICAL` re-prices
  the whole chain against caller-supplied `volatility` /
  `underlying_price` / `interest_rate` / `days_to_expiration`. If any
  of those are off, every Greek and theoretical value in the response
  is off too. Don't set them just to round-trip — leave them `None`
  unless the user is explicitly asking for a re-priced chain.
- **Market hours — REST `/quotes` is RTH-anchored by design.**
  Per the Schwab Streamer docs, `LEVELONE_EQUITIES` splits
  last-price into Field 3 `Last Price` (all trades) and Field 29
  `Regular Market Last Price` ("Only records regular trade").
  The REST `/marketdata/v1/quotes` response mirrors Field-29
  semantics: `lastPrice`, `netChange`, `mark`, `postMarketChange`,
  `tradeTime`, `quoteTime` all pin at the 4PM regular-session
  close and don't advance during pre/post/overnight. Not a cache
  bug — the endpoint's spec. **For live extended-hours data use
  `/pricehistory` with `needExtendedHoursData=true`**: it returns
  real minute bars with volume from 07:00 ET through the 20:00 ET
  post-market close. The 20:00–07:00 ET **overnight 24/5 session
  is not covered by any Schwab REST endpoint** — passing a start
  date inside that window returns the same standard-session
  dataset. The Streamer API docs don't commit to overnight
  coverage for `LEVELONE_EQUITIES` either (it's the only
  LEVELONE service without explicit "Update Regular / AM-PM"
  columns, and "overnight" / "24/5" appears nowhere in the
  Streamer spec). Overnight visibility for QQQ/SPY/etc. is
  currently a ToS-only surface. The `fields` whitelist on
  `get_quotes` is strict — a narrow list silently drops the
  AH-delta keys, so the `get_quote` / `get_quotes` docstrings
  name them explicitly; preserve that when refactoring.
- **Sandbox vs production.** If you set `SCHWAB_BASE_URL`, make sure
  it points where you intend.
- **Price history parameter combos.** Schwab's `/pricehistory`
  endpoint rejects most `periodType` / `frequencyType` / `period` /
  `frequency` combinations with a terse 400. The valid matrix is in
  the tool docstring. If tempted to add client-side validation, don't
  — the response is specific enough, and the matrix is subject to
  change.
- **Candle timestamps are epoch ms UTC.** Convert to
  `America/New_York` when formatting for display or computing session
  boundaries.
- **Transactions endpoint takes ISO-8601 with milliseconds.**
  `startDate` / `endDate` on `/trader/v1/accounts/{hash}/transactions`
  require the full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000Z` shape — a bare
  `YYYY-MM-DD` 400s. `_normalize_iso_datetime()` in `schwab_client.py`
  expands pure dates (start→`00:00:00.000Z`, end→`23:59:59.999Z`) so
  the tool can accept either shape from the model. Don't reach into
  that helper to drop the ms — Schwab rejects `...:00Z`.
- **Transaction records nest the per-leg details in `transferItems`.**
  A single `TRADE` record carries an array: one entry per leg
  (each with `price`, `amount` as signed quantity, `cost`, and an
  `instrument` block) plus separate entries for commissions and
  fees marked with `feeType`. Don't read `transaction.price` as the
  fill price — that field is a summary / may not be set. Iterate
  `transferItems` and filter on the instrument to reconstruct leg
  fills, commissions, and realized P&L.
- **Account number vs. hash.** `/trader/v1/accounts` returns the
  plaintext `accountNumber`; every other `/trader/v1/accounts/{X}`
  endpoint expects the `hashValue` from
  `/trader/v1/accounts/accountNumbers`. `get_account_numbers` is the
  discovery tool. The `get_transactions` / `get_orders` tools
  auto-resolve when exactly one account is authorized, so
  single-account users can skip the lookup; multi-account users must
  pass `account_hash` explicitly.
- **Orders endpoint lookback is ~60 days.** Unlike transactions
  (~1 year), `/trader/v1/accounts/{hash}/orders` rejects a
  `fromEnteredTime` older than 60 days. The `get_orders` tool
  defaults both date params to "last 60 days" on purpose — don't
  widen that default without also handling the upstream 400. Same
  ISO-8601-with-milliseconds format as the transactions endpoint;
  `_normalize_iso_datetime()` is reused.
- **Multi-leg / conditional orders nest under `childOrderStrategies`.**
  A single order record's top-level `orderLegCollection` holds the
  primary legs, but OCO groups and trigger (first-triggers-next)
  orders hang the other legs under `childOrderStrategies` as full
  order sub-objects (each with its own `orderId`, `status`,
  `orderLegCollection`). Flattening to "legs on this order" has to
  walk that array recursively — don't read `orderLegCollection`
  alone.
- **TA-Lib is a C dep.** Use conda-forge (`ta-lib`) or the distro
  package; the pip wrapper needs the native library present first. If
  the wrapper imports but returns garbage, check the C lib version
  matches what the wheel was built against. Don't silently fall back
  to a pure-Python reimplementation — indicator outputs won't match
  what users expect from TA-Lib.
- **TA-Lib warmup NaNs.** Indicators need history before producing a
  value (SMA(20) returns NaN for the first 19 points). `ta.py`
  converts those to JSON `null`; don't strip them — the positions
  have to stay aligned with `datetime`.
- **Series size.** `run_technical_analysis` returns one value per
  candle per indicator by default. A year of 1-minute bars × several
  indicators can blow up the response. Push callers toward `tail` or
  a coarser frequency when they don't need the full history.

**What not to do.**

- Don't store OAuth tokens in the repo, in env files committed to git,
  or in log output.
- Don't introduce an ORM, a database, or a queue. Thin HTTP client
  plus MCP surface — keep it thin.
- Don't add write operations. Schwab's API supports them; this
  provider does not, by policy.
- Don't paper over rate limits with exponential-retry loops. One retry
  for a transient 5xx is fine; 429s should propagate.
- Don't re-attempt the RTD COM path without Office's MSO TLB and a
  concrete plan for `win32com.universal`.

### yahoo

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to Yahoo Finance via
[`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/). Exists for users
without a Schwab developer account. Tool surface intentionally
matches `schwab` so prompts are portable. When Yahoo can't cover a
capability, the tool raises `YahooCapabilityError` rather than
inventing a response.

**Secrets.** None. yfinance is unauthenticated.

**Capability gaps vs. schwab.**

- **`get_accounts`** — raises. Yahoo is a data source, not a brokerage.
- **`get_market_hours`** — raises. Yahoo has no authoritative
  session-hours endpoint.
- **`get_option_chain`** — works but: no Greeks
  (`delta`/`gamma`/`theta`/`vega`/`rho` are `null`), delayed ~15 min,
  illiquid strikes can show stale or zero bid/ask, bid/ask sizes
  emitted as `0`. Response carries a top-level `dataQualityWarning`
  key. Only `strategy="SINGLE"`; strategies and the `ANALYTICAL`-only
  numeric overrides raise.
- **`get_option_expirations`** — returns date list only;
  `expirationType` / `settlementType` / `optionRoots` / `standard`
  are `null`.
- **`get_movers`** — US-market-wide Yahoo screeners, not per-index.
  `sort` selects the screener; `index` is only used when it matches a
  raw Yahoo screener key; `frequency` is ignored.
- **`search_instruments`** — Yahoo's symbol search is fuzzy; all
  `symbol-*` / `desc-*` / `search` projections return the same list.
- **Intraday history depth** — 1m history caps at ~7 days, all
  sub-hourly bars at ~60 days.
- **Option symbology** — Yahoo's own format (e.g.
  `SPY250321C00500000`, no padding). The client does not translate
  to/from Schwab's OSI.
- **10-minute bars** — Yahoo doesn't support them; `frequency=10`
  raises rather than substituting 15m.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **`yfinance` version drift.** Yahoo's endpoints change; breakage
  shows up as `yfinance` exceptions or unexpected empty responses.
  First debugging step is always `pip install -U yfinance` and see if
  upstream shipped a fix.
- **`.info` is slow and rate-limit-prone.** Assembles via several
  HTTP requests. Only called for quotes (bid/ask/sizes) and for
  `projection="fundamental"`. Don't add more callers without reason.
- **Timestamps.** yfinance returns pandas Timestamps with tz. The
  client converts to UTC epoch ms to match the Schwab candle schema.
  If you change the conversion, make sure `analytics.py` still sees
  strictly increasing ms values — it infers annualization from bar
  spacing.
- **Splits / dividends.** `history(..., auto_adjust=False)` gives raw
  OHLC; switching to adjusted prices would change the outputs of
  every `analyze_*` tool. Don't flip the default without updating
  docstrings and tests.
- **Empty candles.** Yahoo drops rows for holidays and halted
  sessions. The client skips NaN rows rather than emitting
  zero-filled bars; an empty `candles` list means the request window
  had no data (common for 1m bars older than ~7 days).
- **Screeners.** `yf.screen(...)` occasionally returns a dict with
  an empty `quotes` list when Yahoo throttles; don't mistake it for
  "no movers today." Log the full response if you see this.
- **Option IV units.** yfinance reports IV as decimal (`0.42` = 42%);
  Schwab reports it as percent (`42.0`). `get_option_chain`
  normalizes to Schwab's convention on the way out — don't
  double-multiply if you touch that path.
- **`Ticker.option_chain(date)` is one HTTP per expiration.** A full
  SPY request is dozens of round-trips. Encourage callers to narrow
  with `from_date` / `to_date` / `exp_month`.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add an `auth` subcommand — yfinance is unauthenticated.
- Don't translate option-symbol formats inside this client.
- Don't paper over 429/Cloudflare responses with retry loops.
- Don't copy-adjust prices silently. Expose a flag and document it.

### fred

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to the
[FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/). Economic-
release calendar (CPI, PPI, NFP, GDP, PCE, retail sales, JOLTS),
release/series metadata, and observation time-series for any of FRED's
~800 000 series.

**Secrets.** `FRED_API_KEY` (free, from
<https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys>).

**Why the heavy lifting lives server-side.** FRED's `/releases/dates`
is a firehose of low-signal releases:

1. **"FOMC Press Release" (release 101) spam** when
   `include_release_dates_with_no_data=true`: fires on every day of
   a meeting window, so a two-week window returns ~14 copies. The
   curated `get_high_impact_calendar` excludes release 101; its
   docstring points callers at the `fed-calendar` provider's
   `get_fomc_meetings` for FOMC dates.
2. **No knob to filter by release** on `/releases/dates` itself.
   `get_release_schedule(release_ids=[...])` and
   `get_high_impact_calendar` fan out per-release and merge the rows.

**FRED release-id cheatsheet for common trading-relevant prints**
(these change rarely; verify with `list_releases` if in doubt):

| Release                          | `release_id` | Common series IDs                                    |
|----------------------------------|-------------:|------------------------------------------------------|
| Consumer Price Index             |           10 | `CPIAUCSL` (headline), `CPILFESL` (core)             |

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Realtime vs. observation dates.** FRED distinguishes *realtime*
  (the vintage — when was this value visible to market participants?)
  from *observation* (which period does the value describe?). The
  release-calendar endpoints are realtime-scoped; series observations
  are observation-scoped. Mixing them up puts the wrong dates in
  front of the user.
- **Empty release dates.** When `include_empty=True`, future scheduled
  dates appear with no data yet. That's the signal for "upcoming
  release" — don't filter them out.
- **Series-level units.** Passing `units="pch"` computes a percent
  change server-side. Computing it client-side *too* will
  double-transform.
- **Rate limit.** 120 requests per 60s per key. A tight loop over
  `get_release_series(...)` for many releases will trip it; batch
  with higher `limit` instead.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add an OAuth flow — FRED uses a static API key.
- Don't cache responses silently. If caching is useful, expose the
  TTL and signal stale-hit in the response.
- Don't reshape the FRED JSON into a "nicer" schema. The model can
  read the raw shape; hiding fields makes debugging harder.

### fed-calendar

**What it is.** Read-only scrape of
<https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm>.
Dates and flags only (meeting date range, SEP flag, press-conference
URL, parenthetical notes). No JSON/ICS/RSS feed exists for this
calendar; HTML scrape is the primary source.

**Secrets.** None. federalreserve.gov is public.

**HTML structure we depend on.** Documented so the next person
touching `fomc_scraper.py` knows exactly what will break it. Source:
federalreserve.gov as of 2026.

- Each year is a `div.panel.panel-default` under the article body. The
  heading text contains the year (e.g. `"2026 FOMC Meetings"`).
- Each meeting is a `div.row.fomc-meeting` inside that panel.
- Month label: `div.fomc-meeting__month > strong` — full month names,
  or `"April/May"` style for meetings that straddle two months.
- Date range: `div.fomc-meeting__date` — `"27-28"`, `"8-9*"` (SEP),
  `"22 (notation vote)"`, or parenthetical-only for unscheduled items.
- SEP footnote: trailing literal `*` on the date cell.
- Press conference: `<a>` with `href` matching regex
  `fomcpres{1,2}conf` (Fed has historically used both spellings).
- Minutes / statement URLs: label or href keyword match; not
  semantically tagged.

The panel-footer holds the SEP legend. We don't parse it — the `*`
flag is self-documenting in the tool docstring.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Fed layout changes.** If every tool call starts failing with "no
  FOMC year panels found", inspect the HTML in a browser and update
  the selectors in `fomc_scraper.py` to match. Don't paper over with
  fuzzy fallbacks.
- **Two-month meetings.** Occasionally a meeting spans April/May or
  October/November. The month cell reads e.g. `"April/May"` and the
  date cell gives two days in different months. The scraper anchors
  `start_date` to the first month, `end_date` to the second. If the
  Fed ever publishes a three-day straddle (unprecedented), logic
  needs updating.
- **Notation votes / unscheduled items.** Purely parenthetical rows
  (e.g. `"(notation vote)"`) with no days are skipped — no date to
  anchor to.
- **Timezone.** `utc_today()` uses UTC. A FOMC decision is an ET
  event, so "today" / "tomorrow" can disagree by a few hours on the
  edges. Document the UTC choice in the tool response rather than
  faking ET.
- **Rate limiting.** federalreserve.gov isn't aggressive, but each
  tool call sends one request. If this grows, add an explicit TTL
  cache — don't let the agent accidentally loop.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add aggregator fallbacks. Fed page is the only source.
- Don't extend to every central bank in one commit. If ECB/BoE/BoJ
  coverage is worth adding, land each as its own module with its own
  primary-source scraper.
- Don't silently cache. If caching helps, expose a visible TTL in
  the response.
- Don't "enhance" meeting records with computed fields that aren't on
  the Fed page (rate-decision probability from fed funds futures,
  etc.). That belongs in analysis code, not the primary-source
  scraper.

### sec-edgar

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to SEC EDGAR (`data.sec.gov`,
`www.sec.gov/Archives`, `efts.sec.gov`). Filings (10-K/10-Q/8-K/S-1/
proxy + FPI equivalents 20-F/6-K), Form 4 insider transactions, 13F
institutional holdings, and XBRL company facts per-company and
cross-sectionally.

**Secrets.** None — EDGAR is public and unauthenticated. The only
configuration is `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT`, which lives in `.env`.
Example value (use a real name/email, not a placeholder):
`SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=traider-hub you@example.com`.

**SEC Fair Access requirements.**

- **Descriptive `User-Agent` required.** Every request must carry a
  UA that identifies the client and includes a contact email, or SEC
  will IP-block. The client enforces this at construction via
  `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` — **do not** hardcode a default email or
  silently fall back to a generic UA. Fail loud.
- **10 requests/second per IP.** Enforced client-side with a token
  bucket in `edgar_client.py`. On 429 or 403, the client raises
  `SecEdgarRateLimitError` and stops — no retry loops. If a tool
  needs higher throughput than the bucket allows (13F fan-out, large
  Form 4 batches), push pagination to the caller.
- **UA email out of logs.** The UA is a config value, not a secret,
  but it's the user's real contact email in outbound headers. Don't
  include it in tool response bodies — it stays at the HTTP layer.

**Scoping choices made in v1.** These answers should be preserved
until there's a concrete user need to change:

1. **Form 4 is issuer-scoped.** You can list a company's insider
   trades, but there's no "all of CEO Jane Doe's trades across her
   boards" tool. Would need fan-out over her reporting-owner CIK;
   add it only if asked.
2. **13F reverse lookup is not shipped.** `get_institutional_portfolio`
   reads one filer's holdings; no "who holds AAPL?" tool. Real-time
   reverse lookup against SEC alone is O(managers × filings) per
   query — impractical without an in-process index. Defer until
   asked, then decide between building the index and wiring a vendor
   dataset.
3. **Foreign private issuers are included.** Default form-type
   filters don't exclude `20-F` / `6-K`. Users who only want US
   filers can pass `form_types=["10-K", "10-Q", "8-K"]`.
4. **Caching: only the ticker map.** `company_tickers.json` has a
   24-hour TTL (exposed via `ticker_map_fetched_at` in every response
   that consults it). Filings, company facts, concepts, and frames
   are **not cached** — they change on every filing and stale reads
   would mislead. Visible `fetched_at` on every response.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **XBRL concept names are not uniform across filers.** Some
  companies tag revenue as `Revenues`, others as `SalesRevenueNet`,
  others as `RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax`.
  `get_company_concept` 404s on the wrong name. When a lookup
  fails, try `get_company_facts` to see what the filer actually tags,
  or use `get_frame` which aggregates across the concept.
- **Frame periods: duration vs. instantaneous.** Balance-sheet
  concepts (`Assets`, `Liabilities`) only exist as instantaneous
  values — the frame period must end in `I` (e.g. `CY2024Q4I`). Flow
  concepts (`Revenues`, `NetIncomeLoss`) are duration — no `I`
  suffix. Mixing returns 404.
- **13F value units changed in 2022.** SEC switched 13F `value` from
  thousands of dollars to whole dollars for periods ending on or
  after 2022-09-30. The parser infers the unit from `period_of_report`
  and tags it on the envelope. If aggregating, check that field
  before summing.
- **Amendments are separate form codes.** `10-K/A`, `10-Q/A`,
  `8-K/A`, `4/A`, `13F-HR/A` are distinct filings, not silently
  merged. `form_types=["10-K"]` will *not* match `10-K/A`.
- **Submissions feed only holds recent filings inline.** Older
  history spills into `filings.files[*]` overflow JSONs referenced
  by name. The tool layer reads only the inline recent block; for
  deep history, the client has `submissions_overflow(...)` but it's
  not fanned out at the MCP layer yet. Add only when asked.
- **Rate limit is real.** 10 req/sec is enforced by SEC at the IP
  level; the client's token bucket matches. Fan-outs over many
  Form 4 filings *will* hit the wall — prefer fewer, larger tool
  calls and tell the model to paginate.
- **Full-text search endpoint is undocumented.** `efts.sec.gov` powers
  EDGAR's public search page; its response shape is Elasticsearch's
  and SEC can change it without notice. The tool passes raw hits
  through — brittleness is worth the signal.

**What not to do.**

- Don't hardcode a default `User-Agent`. SEC bans "sample UA strings
  copied from the docs." Require the env var.
- Don't retry 429s or 403s. Raise, let the user see the throttle.
- Don't cache filing contents. Filings are immutable once filed, but
  the *set* of filings changes constantly.
- Don't reshape `companyfacts` / `companyconcept` JSON into a "nicer"
  schema.
- Don't add aggregator fallbacks (Yahoo financials, Simply Wall St).
  Primary-source-only.

### factor

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to the
[Ken French Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).
Fama-French 3/5-factor, momentum, short/long-term reversal, and
N-industry portfolios at monthly / weekly / daily frequencies. Plus an
escape hatch for any other file on the library.

**Secrets.** None. The library is unauthenticated.

**Caching.** ZIPs are disk-cached under `$FACTOR_CACHE_DIR` (default
`~/.cache/traider-factor/`, or `/cache` in the Docker image, mounted
from the host). Cache key is the dataset filename; TTL is per-call
(default 24 h, override with `ttl_seconds=…` on any tool).
`refresh=True` bypasses the cache for one call without invalidating
it for other callers.

The Docker volume mount (`${HOME}/.cache/traider-factor:/cache`)
persists the cache across container restarts. Dropping it causes
every restart to re-fetch — harmless (files are small) but wasteful.

**CSV parser internals.** `french_client.py` is the parser that
matters. Ken French CSVs embed multiple tables in one file, separated
by blank lines, with optional multi-line titles and a
`,Col1,Col2,...` header row. The parser is block-based: split on
blank lines, identify the data-header row inside each block, treat
prose lines above it as the section title, rows below as data.

**Units and sentinels.**

- **Returns are in percent**, not decimals. A value of `2.96` means
  +2.96%, not +296%.
- **Missing values** in the source file are `-99.99` or `-999`. The
  parser converts them to `None` so downstream math doesn't treat
  them as -100% returns.
- **RF** in the factor files is the 1-month T-bill rate for the
  corresponding period (also in percent).

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Units trap.** Values are percents — don't multiply by 100 "to
  convert" them; they already are. Mixing factor returns (pct) with
  raw equity returns (decimal) gives nonsense regressions.
- **Annual blocks** lexicographically sort fine vs. monthly but
  `"2024" > "2023-12"` under string comparison, which is what
  `filter_rows_by_date` uses. Pass bounds matching the frequency of
  the section you're reading (`YYYY` for annual, `YYYY-MM` for
  monthly, `YYYY-MM-DD` for daily). Mixing them quietly filters out
  rows you meant to keep.
- **Industry column names are Ken French's, not yours.** `Durbl`
  isn't a ticker — it's the "Consumer Durables" bucket. See
  `list_datasets`.
- **Daily files are large.** The 48-industry daily file is ~9 MB
  unzipped with ~26k rows. Filter server-side by date rather than
  pulling the whole thing.
- **Filenames aren't intuitive.** `F-F_Research_Data_5_Factors_2x3`
  is the 5-factor file; `2x3` is the sort methodology, not the column
  count. `list_datasets` maps the short-form `model` parameter to
  the right filename.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add a pandas-datareader fallback. The URL pattern is stable;
  if it breaks, raise.
- Don't silently widen the cache TTL to mask a fetch failure. TTL is
  per-call and explicit.
- Don't reshape column names ("Mkt-RF" → "market_minus_rf"). Ken
  French names are canonical in the literature.
- Don't add a "compute alpha / factor exposure" tool here. This
  provider fetches and parses; any regression belongs in a separate
  tool or client-side over this + a market-data backend.

### treasury

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to the
[Treasury Fiscal Data API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov). Three
primary-source datasets:

- **Securities auction results** — bid-to-cover, stop-out yield/rate,
  primary-dealer takedown, direct/indirect bidder share.
- **Daily Treasury Statement (DTS)** — operating cash balance (TGA),
  deposits/withdrawals, public-debt transactions, etc.
- **Debt to the Penny** — daily total public debt outstanding.

**Yield curve is deliberately not here.** FRED mirrors Treasury's
H.15 in full (`DGS1MO` … `DGS30`, `DFII*` for TIPS). This provider
exists for the Treasury datasets FRED does not carry at useful
granularity.

**Secrets.** None. Fiscal Data is unauthenticated. We still send a
descriptive UA so Treasury's logs can identify the traffic.

**Fiscal Data query dialect.** All three tools funnel through one
`TreasuryClient.query` method:

- `filter` — `field:op:value,field:op:value,...` where op is `eq`,
  `gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt`, `in`.
- `fields` — comma-separated projection.
- `sort` — field name, `-` prefix for desc.
- `page[size]` / `page[number]` — page size max 10 000, 1-indexed.

If a user asks for something outside the curated tool surface
(a different dataset in the Fiscal Data catalog), expose it as a new
tool rather than repurposing `query` as a raw passthrough. Value lives
in the projection and defaults.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **The DTS changed format in 2022.** The legacy PDF format and the
  new JSON-native tables differ. This provider only talks to the new
  Fiscal Data tables (`/v1/accounting/dts/...`). Data before Oct 2022
  returns new-format columns only — the endpoints will not
  reconstruct the old table structure.
- **Amounts are strings.** Fiscal Data returns monetary fields as
  strings (e.g. `"847182563921.43"`) to preserve precision. Don't
  assume numeric JSON; the client returns JSON verbatim.
- **`record_date` vs. reporting window.** DTS `record_date` is the
  date the statement covers (usually T-1 settlement). Auction
  `record_date` is the date the record was published; use
  `auction_date` for filtering when you care about auction timing.
- **Paging matters for long windows.** Default page size 100. A full
  year of daily TGA balances is ~260 rows (under one page); a full
  year of auctions can exceed 1 000 rows. Bump `limit` or iterate
  `page`.
- **Yield curve is elsewhere.** 2Y / 10Y / 30Y time series →
  `fred` provider's `get_series("DGS10")` — not `get_auction_results`.
  Auction high yields are stop-out yields for a specific sale, not a
  secondary-market curve.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add a yield-curve tool here. Route to FRED.
- Don't add a "secondary-market rate" tool — also FRED (H.15).
- Don't reshape Fiscal Data's column names.
- Don't cache responses silently. If caching becomes necessary, expose
  the TTL and signal stale-hit in the response.
- Don't retry 429s. Let them propagate.

### news

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to Massive's
`/v2/reference/news` endpoint. The rest of Massive's surface (quotes,
aggregates, trades) is intentionally out of scope — traider already
has dedicated market-data backends.

Articles carry publisher metadata, the tickers they reference, and a
per-ticker `insights` array with Massive's sentiment label and
reasoning. **That sentiment is Massive's model output, not a primary-
source fact** — treat it as one signal among many, not ground truth.

**Secrets.** `MASSIVE_API_KEY` (register at
<https://massive.com>). Sent as an `apiKey` query param on every
request. Do not log it.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Ticker is case-sensitive.** Massive documents `ticker` as
  case-sensitive. Pass `AAPL`, not `aapl`.
- **`published_utc` is RFC3339.** For minute-level precision, use the
  full timestamp (e.g. `2026-04-18T13:30:00Z`). ISO dates also work.
- **Sentiment is Massive's, not yours.** `insights[].sentiment` is a
  model label ("positive" / "negative" / "neutral") with a
  `sentiment_reasoning` blurb. Quote with attribution; don't
  aggregate or average across articles without flagging that as
  interpretation.
- **Pagination uses `next_url`.** Massive returns a pre-built cursor
  URL in the response — follow it if needed. The tool does not
  aggregate pages for you.
- **Free tier rate limits.** Massive throttles free-tier keys. A burst
  of `get_news` calls will 429; the tool surfaces it instead of
  retrying silently. Back off or batch.

**What not to do.**

- Don't expand into Massive's other endpoints (aggregates, trades,
  fundamentals) — re-introduces the "which provider owns quotes?"
  routing ambiguity traider avoids.
- Don't cache responses silently. News freshness is the whole point;
  a stale cache hit defeats the tool.
- Don't retry 429s internally.
- Don't blend Massive's feed with another news provider in one tool
  call. A second news source gets its own provider.

### earnings

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to
[Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/docs/api). Two free-tier endpoints:

- ``/calendar/earnings`` — forward- and backward-looking earnings
  calendar with consensus EPS / revenue.
- ``/stock/earnings`` — per-ticker history of EPS actual vs.
  estimate (surprise%).

Everything else on Finnhub's surface (quotes, fundamentals,
sentiment, recommendation trends, ...) is intentionally out of
scope — quotes stay on the market-data backend, filings on
``sec-edgar``, news on ``news``.

**Secrets.** ``FINNHUB_API_KEY`` (register at
<https://finnhub.io>). Sent as the ``X-Finnhub-Token`` header on
every request. Do not log it and do not fall through to a header-
less request — free tier returns 401 without the token.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Free-tier coverage is US issuers.** Finnhub's ``international``
  flag on the calendar endpoint requires a paid plan; this client
  does not expose it. If a ticker looks right but the calendar
  returns empty, it's likely a non-US listing.
- **Rate limit is 60 req/min.** Enforced upstream; 429s propagate
  as ``FinnhubError`` with no retry loop. A fan-out over many
  tickers will trip it — prefer one cross-market calendar call
  over per-ticker loops when possible.
- **Consensus is Finnhub's aggregation.** ``epsEstimate`` /
  ``revenueEstimate`` are Finnhub's sell-side consensus, not a
  primary-source fact. Quote with attribution. Actuals (``epsActual``
  / ``revenueActual``) *are* primary — they come from the 8-K /
  earnings release.
- **``hour`` field semantics.** ``"bmo"`` = before market open,
  ``"amc"`` = after market close, ``"dmh"`` = during market hours,
  ``""`` = not specified. The empty string is common for smaller
  names — surface it, don't guess.
- **``stock/earnings`` returns a list, not a dict.** The tool layer
  wraps it in a dict so the response is citable (``source`` +
  ``fetched_at`` envelope). Don't flatten that envelope without a
  replacement for the provenance fields.
- **Date format.** The calendar endpoint takes ``YYYY-MM-DD`` for
  both ``from`` and ``to`` and requires both — there's no
  "one day" shortcut. The tool defaults ``to_date`` to
  ``from_date + 14`` days so the common "upcoming two weeks" query
  is a zero-arg call.
- **EPS units.** Reported in USD per share, regardless of the
  issuer's primary currency. Revenue is in USD (absolute dollars,
  not thousands).

**What not to do.**

- Don't add an OAuth flow — Finnhub is a static API key.
- Don't widen the tool surface to quotes / fundamentals /
  sentiment. Re-introduces the "which provider owns quotes?"
  ambiguity traider was consolidated to avoid.
- Don't retry 429s internally — surface them so the user can back
  off.
- Don't cache responses silently. Earnings dates and consensus
  shift as analysts revise; a stale cache hit would feed wrong
  numbers into a recommendation.
- Don't reshape the Finnhub JSON beyond adding the ``source`` /
  ``fetched_at`` envelope. The model reads raw fields
  (``hour``, ``epsEstimate``, ``surprisePercent``) directly.

### estimates

**What it is.** Read-only bridge to Finnhub's analyst-recommendation
endpoint. One free-tier endpoint:

- ``/stock/recommendation`` — monthly sell-side rating distribution
  per ticker (strong-buy / buy / hold / sell / strong-sell counts).

Finnhub's other estimates endpoints (``/stock/price-target``,
``/stock/upgrade-downgrade``, ``/stock/eps-estimate``,
``/stock/revenue-estimate``) all require a paid plan and return 403
with a free key — they are deliberately not wired. Upgrading the key
later is a one-method extension of ``finnhub_client.py``.

The client is a near-duplicate of ``earnings/finnhub_client.py`` —
same auth header, same error handling, same rate-limit story. They
are intentionally separate so either provider can load without the
other (the hub rule: providers don't import from each other).

**Secrets.** ``FINNHUB_API_KEY``, shared with the ``earnings``
provider. One key, both providers. Do not log it.

**Things that will bite you.**

- **Shared rate-limit budget.** 60 req/min is enforced per key
  across *all* Finnhub endpoints, so enabling both ``earnings`` and
  ``estimates`` means their calls compete for the same budget. A
  fan-out in one will 429 the other. Propagate, don't retry.
- **Free-tier gap is load-bearing.** Users will ask for price
  targets, upgrade/downgrade actions, and consensus EPS. None of
  those are reachable. The tool docstring and the provider README
  call this out — do not paper over by reconstructing from training
  data or another provider. Surface the gap, let the user decide
  whether to pay for the tier.
- **Unknown tickers return ``200 []``, not a 404.** Don't treat an
  empty list as an error — surface it as "no coverage" to the user.
  Conversely, don't retry a ticker that returned ``[]`` in hopes of
  different data; the list is authoritative for the moment.
- **Period is month-start, not month-end.** ``period: "2026-04-01"``
  is the April 2026 snapshot. Sort newest-first by that date; don't
  assume the upstream already sorted.
- **Rating counts aren't EPS revisions.** Month-over-month deltas in
  the five buckets are *rating*-revision breadth. The lay reading
  ("analysts are revising up") conflates this with EPS-estimate
  revisions, which this endpoint does **not** cover. Keep the two
  labels distinct in any analyst output.

**What not to do.**

- Don't add an OAuth flow — Finnhub is a static API key.
- Don't silently fall back to the Yahoo / Schwab analyst fields or
  to training data when the paid endpoints 403. Raise / surface the
  403.
- Don't cache responses silently. Rating trends shift
  month-to-month; a stale cache hit feeds wrong distributions into
  recommendations.
- Don't reshape the Finnhub JSON beyond adding the ``source`` /
  ``fetched_at`` / ``symbol`` / ``trends`` envelope.
- Don't merge this provider into ``earnings``. Separate providers
  keep the load costs and failure modes independent — a 403 on one
  endpoint shouldn't poison the other.
