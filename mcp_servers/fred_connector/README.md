# fred-connector

Read-only [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) bridge exposed as an
MCP server. One of the MCP servers bundled in the
[`traider`](../../README.md) hub (see the root
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for how the hub is organized). See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) in this directory for the per-server
constraints and gotchas.

Unlike `schwab_connector` / `yahoo_connector`, this server is
**additive**: it exposes macro / economic-release data rather than
equity quotes, and it runs on a different port (8766) so it can sit
alongside whichever market-data backend you picked.

## What this MCP server can do

All tools are **read-only**. Every response is FRED's JSON
essentially unchanged — the model can introspect raw fields rather
than second-guessing a translation.

### `get_release_schedule(...)`

Economic-release calendar, **filtered server-side**. Defaults to a
forward-looking window (`realtime_start` = today UTC) so you're not
dragging down years of history to find next week's CPI print.

- `realtime_start` / `realtime_end` — ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Override the
  default (today → FRED's horizon) when you want history.
- `release_ids` — fan out to FRED's per-release endpoint once per id
  and merge. Cleanest way to cut noise when you already know the
  handful of releases you care about. See `list_releases` for ids.
- `name_contains` — list of substrings, OR'd together, case-insensitive
  match on `release_name`. Useful when you know the name but not the
  id (e.g. `["Consumer Price", "Personal Income", "Employment"]`).
- `include_empty=True` keeps scheduled future dates that don't yet
  carry values — that's how a forward-looking calendar finds upcoming
  prints.
- `dedupe=True` drops duplicate `(date, release_id)` rows (FRED
  sometimes emits near-duplicates).
- `limit`, `sort_order` — standard FRED knobs.

For **FOMC meeting dates** specifically, use
[`fed_calendar_connector`](../fed_calendar_connector/README.md)'s
`get_fomc_meetings` — FRED's release 101 ("FOMC Press Release") fires
on every day of the meeting window, which is too noisy to be useful.

### `get_high_impact_calendar(...)`

Curated shortcut over `get_release_schedule` — pre-wired with the
release IDs a trader actually cares about (CPI, PCE, PPI, NFP,
JOLTS, GDP, Retail Sales) and a `category` annotation on each row.

- `categories` — subset of `inflation`, `labor`, `growth`, `consumer`;
  `None` = all.
- Other params match `get_release_schedule`.
- **Does not cover FOMC** — see `get_fomc_meetings` on
  `fed_calendar_connector`. For anything outside the curated list,
  fall back to `get_release_schedule` with your own `release_ids` or
  `name_contains`.

### `get_release_dates(release_id, ...)`

Past *and* scheduled publication dates for one release. Use
`list_releases` first to find the `release_id`. Key IDs:

| Release                      | `release_id` |
|------------------------------|-------------:|
| Consumer Price Index (CPI)   |           10 |
| Employment Situation (NFP)   |           50 |
| GDP                          |           53 |
| PCE (Personal Income)        |           21 |
| Retail Sales                 |           32 |
| JOLTS                        |          192 |
| FOMC Meeting                 |          101 |

### `list_releases(limit=200)`

All FRED releases. Use this to discover `release_id` values.

### `get_release_info(release_id)`

Metadata for one release — name, press-release URL, notes.

### `get_release_series(release_id, ...)`

Series that live under a release (e.g. CPI headline, core CPI, and
every component).

### `search_series(search_text, ...)`

Fuzzy search over series IDs and titles. Examples:

- `"core CPI"` → `CPILFESL`
- `"10-year treasury"` → `DGS10`
- `"fed funds"` → `FEDFUNDS` / `DFF`
- `"unemployment rate"` → `UNRATE`

### `get_series_info(series_id)`

Metadata for one series: units, frequency, seasonal adjustment,
last-updated timestamp.

### `get_series(series_id, ...)`

The actual time-series observations. `units` can do server-side
transforms:

- `lin` (default) — levels
- `chg` — change, `ch1` — year-over-year change
- `pch` — % change, `pc1` — YoY % change, `pca` — % change annualized
- `log` — natural log

`frequency` + `aggregation_method` resample on the server (`m`, `q`,
`a` with `avg` / `sum` / `eop`).

## Setup

### 1. Get a FRED API key (free)

Register at <https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys>. No rate
tier shopping — the free key is the only tier.

### 2. Put the key in `.env`

At the repo root:

```
FRED_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 3. Install

```bash
conda activate traider
pip install -e ./mcp_servers/fred_connector
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
fred-connector                                           # stdio
fred-connector --transport streamable-http --port 8766   # HTTP
```

Or via Docker (together with whichever backend is active), from the
repo root:

```bash
docker compose --profile fred up -d
```

## Connect your AI CLI

Same recipes as the rest of the hub; the
[hub README](../../README.md#connect-your-ai-cli) has the full
Claude Code / OpenCode / Gemini CLI examples. The HTTP endpoint is
`http://localhost:8766/mcp`.

## Prompts that put these tools to work

- **"What US macro releases are scheduled for the next 10 days?"** —
  `get_release_schedule(realtime_start=<today>, include_empty=True)`
- **"When's the next CPI print?"** — `get_release_dates(release_id=10,
  realtime_start=<today>)`
- **"Has core PCE been trending up or down YoY?"** —
  `get_series("PCEPILFE", units="pc1")`
- **"Plot the unemployment rate for the last five years."** —
  `get_series("UNRATE", observation_start=<5y ago>)`
- **"What's the 10Y–2Y yield spread doing?"** —
  `get_series("T10Y2Y")` (it's precomputed by FRED)

Pair these with `schwab_connector` / `yahoo_connector` prompts to
condition equity decisions on the macro calendar — e.g. *"run
analyze_returns on SPY then show me what CPI prints overlap that
window."*

## Things worth knowing

- **Rate limit.** 120 requests per 60s per key. The tool surfaces
  FRED's 429 as a `FredError`; back off, don't retry-loop.
- **Realtime vs. observation.** The release calendar is *realtime*-
  dated (when was the value published); series observations are
  *observation*-dated (which period they describe). The tool
  parameters separate the two.
- **Empty release dates.** `include_empty=True` is what surfaces
  *future* scheduled dates that don't have values yet — that's the
  point. Filtering them out would hide the calendar.
- **Free-tier humility.** FRED is maintained by one Fed reserve bank
  on public funding. Uptime is very good but not nine-nines; if a
  tool call fails, the server propagates the error rather than
  serving stale data.
