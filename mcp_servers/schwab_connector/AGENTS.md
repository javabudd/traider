# AGENTS.md — schwab_connector

Guidance for AI coding agents working on the **Schwab** MCP server
inside the [`traider`](../../AGENTS.md) hub. If you landed here
without reading the root `AGENTS.md`, read that first — it frames how
this directory fits into the wider collection of MCP servers.

## What this is

`schwab-connector` is a read-only bridge between an AI CLI (via MCP)
and the **Schwab Trader API**. It exposes quote lookups, historical
OHLCV candles, TA-Lib technical-analysis indicators, and pure-numpy
return/risk/correlation/regime analytics as MCP tools so the model can
call them like any other tool. Pure Python over HTTP — cross-platform,
no COM, no desktop app required.

The user-facing tool surface (names, arguments, valid parameter
combinations) is documented in [README.md](README.md) under "What this
MCP server can do". If you add or change a tool, update that section —
it's what MCP clients read to learn what's available.

### Why not the TOS RTD path anymore

The repo originally tried to reach TOS Desktop's RTD COM server
(`Tos.RTD`, the interface behind Excel's `=RTD("tos.rtd",…)` formulas).
That path is abandoned. The blocking issue: `IRTDUpdateEvent` is a
dual COM interface, and pywin32 can only synthesize a real vtable for
a dual interface from a registered type library (Office's `MSO.DLL`
ships it; plain Windows does not). Without that TLB, every call path
into our Python callback eventually hits undefined vtable memory and
`Py_FatalError`s the process. Investigating that took a lot of time —
don't re-open it without (a) Office installed and (b) a plan to use
`win32com.universal.RegisterInterfaces`.

## Hard constraints

- **Read-only scope.** No order entry, no alert creation, no writes.
  The Trader API can do writes — we deliberately don't. If a feature
  request implies writes, push back.
- **OAuth required.** Schwab's API is OAuth 2.0 (authorization code
  flow). Tokens are refreshed, not re-issued; treat the refresh token
  as sensitive and keep it out of logs.
- **Rate limits apply.** Schwab publishes per-endpoint quotas (see the
  developer portal). Don't add retry-storm fallbacks that mask a
  throttle — surface 429s.

## Layout

All paths below are relative to this directory
(`mcp_servers/schwab_connector/`).

```
src/schwab_connector/
  __init__.py       # re-exports SchwabClient / SchwabAuthError
  __main__.py       # dispatches "auth" subcommand vs. server
  schwab_client.py  # OAuth-authenticated HTTP client
  auth.py           # interactive authorization-code flow
  ta.py             # TA-Lib indicator runner over candle lists
  analytics.py      # pure-numpy return/risk/correlation analytics
  server.py         # FastMCP server: quotes, price history, TA,
                    #   movers, instruments, hours, accounts,
                    #   analyze_* tools
pyproject.toml      # deps: mcp, httpx, python-dotenv, numpy, TA-Lib
```

## Don't start the MCP server yourself

The user runs `schwab-connector` in a separate terminal. You do **not**
need to spawn the server, background it, or restart it — assume it is
already running (or that the user will start it). If a tool call fails
because the server isn't up, tell the user; don't try to launch it.
The same applies to `schwab-connector auth` — that's an interactive
browser flow the user runs themselves.

## Running / developing

**All Python commands for this server run inside the `traider` conda
environment.** Activate it before running anything — `pip`,
`python`, `schwab-connector`, test runners, one-off REPLs, everything.
The env is always named `traider` (Python 3.13); see `README.md` for
creation instructions. If you see an `ImportError` or
`command not found`, the first thing to check is whether the env is
active.

```bash
conda activate traider

# from the repo root:
pip install -e ./mcp_servers/schwab_connector

export SCHWAB_APP_KEY=...
export SCHWAB_APP_SECRET=...
export SCHWAB_CALLBACK_URL=https://127.0.0.1   # must match the app reg

schwab-connector auth                                      # one-time browser flow
schwab-connector                                           # MCP server on stdio
schwab-connector --transport streamable-http --port 8765   # or over HTTP
```

Tokens are persisted to the file referenced by `SCHWAB_TOKEN_FILE`
(default `~/.schwab-connector/schwab-token.json`, mode 0600).
`SchwabClient` auto-refreshes the access token on expiry; if the
refresh token itself is dead, it raises `SchwabAuthError` — the user
must re-run `schwab-connector auth`.

## Server logs

The server writes a rotating log to `logs/server.log` (relative to
cwd). Override with `--log-file PATH` or `SCHWAB_CONNECTOR_LOG`.

MCP servers are typically spawned as subprocesses (stdio transport) or
run detached (HTTP), so stdout/stderr often aren't visible to the
agent calling tools. The log file is the reliable place to read what
the server did. **When a tool call fails, read `logs/server.log`
before asking the user for the traceback** — tool handlers wrap their
bodies in `logger.exception(...)`, so the full traceback lands in the
file.

Captured log sources: `schwab_connector`, `mcp`, `uvicorn`, and `httpx`
(so you can see the outbound API calls and response statuses).
Rotation: 5 MB × 3 backups.

## Things that will bite you

- **Token expiry.** Schwab access tokens expire in ~30 minutes and
  refresh tokens in ~7 days. After a lapse, the user has to re-run
  `schwab-connector auth`. Don't silently swallow "invalid refresh
  token" — surface it.
- **Options symbology.** Schwab expects the 21-character OSI format
  (e.g. `SPY   250321C00500000`), not dotted TOS notation. Equities
  and futures (`/ES`) work as-is.
- **Market hours.** Outside RTH, `lastPrice` may be stale; pre/post
  session fields live under different keys in the quote JSON.
- **Sandbox vs production.** The developer portal offers a sandbox
  environment. If you set `SCHWAB_BASE_URL`, make sure it points where
  you intend.
- **Price history parameter combos.** Schwab's `/pricehistory` endpoint
  rejects most `periodType` / `frequencyType` / `period` / `frequency`
  combinations with a terse 400. The valid matrix is in the README.
  If you're tempted to add client-side validation, don't — the
  response is specific enough, and the matrix is subject to change on
  Schwab's side.
- **Candle timestamps are epoch ms UTC.** When formatting for display
  or computing session boundaries, remember to convert to the right
  tz (Schwab intraday data is US equities — `America/New_York`).
- **TA-Lib is a C dep.** `pip install TA-Lib` needs the native
  library present first (`conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib`,
  `brew install ta-lib`, or the distro package). If the wrapper
  imports but returns garbage, check that the C lib version matches
  what the wheel was built against. Don't silently fall back to a
  pure-Python reimplementation — the indicator outputs won't match
  what users expect from TA-Lib.
- **TA-Lib warmup NaNs.** Indicators need history before producing a
  value (SMA(20) returns NaN for the first 19 points). `ta.py`
  converts those to JSON `null`; don't strip them — the positions
  have to stay aligned with `datetime`.
- **Series size.** `run_technical_analysis` returns one value per
  candle per indicator by default. A year of 1-minute bars × several
  indicators can blow up the response. Push callers toward `tail` or
  a coarser frequency when they don't actually need the full history.

## What not to do

- Don't store OAuth tokens in the repo, in env files committed to git,
  or in log output.
- Don't introduce an ORM, a database, or a queue. This is a thin HTTP
  client plus an MCP surface — keep it thin.
- Don't add write operations. The Trader API supports them; this
  connector does not, by policy.
- Don't paper over rate limits with exponential-retry loops. One retry
  for a transient 5xx is fine; 429s should propagate.
- Don't re-attempt the RTD COM path without Office's MSO TLB and a
  concrete plan for `win32com.universal`. See the "Why not the TOS
  RTD path" section above.
