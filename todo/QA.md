# todo/QA.md — outstanding QA findings for the traider hub

Static-only QA pass on the repo (no runtime). Findings carry file:line
refs and severity. Every entry inherits the hub-wide rules in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): read-only, primary sources preferred,
secrets out of repo/logs, surface 429s, no silent fallbacks, no
fabricated numbers.

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` resolved.

## Triage order

1. #5 (13F unit boundary) — only finding that materially corrupts numbers.
2. #2, #3, #4, #6 — silent fallbacks; AGENTS.md treats these as the
   trust-breaking class of bug.
3. ~~#1 envelope rollout across `schwab` / `yahoo` / `news` / `fred`~~
   (resolved).
4. Security tightening: #7, #8.
5. Land `tests/` + CI; start with parser fixtures (Form 4 XML, 13F
   XML, FOMC HTML snapshot, Ken French CSV block) since those are
   most prone to silent breakage.

## CRITICAL

- [x] **#1 — `source` / `fetched_at` envelope is inconsistently
  applied.** DEVELOPING.md:255-257 makes it a hub convention;
  `factor`, `sec_edgar`, `earnings`, `estimates` honor it; most of
  `schwab`, `yahoo`, `news`, and `fred` don't. A `get_quote` or
  `get_news` response can't be cited per the AGENTS.md "cite tool +
  timestamp for every number" rule.
  - `schwab/tools.py`: `get_quote` (~68), `get_quotes` (~139),
    `get_price_history` (~189), `get_option_chain` (~344),
    `get_option_expirations` (~475), `get_movers` (~492),
    `search_instruments` (~517), and all account / transaction /
    order tools — none stamp source/fetched_at.
  - `yahoo/tools.py`: same set (lines ~69, 91, 109, 213, 335, 353,
    376).
  - `news/tools.py:83` — returns Massive's raw envelope only.
  - `fred/tools.py` — none of the @mcp.tool functions stamp it.
  - **Resolved:** every `@mcp.tool` in `schwab`, `yahoo`, `news`,
    and `fred` now stamps `source` (upstream URL) and `fetched_at`
    (ISO-8601 UTC) at the top level of its response. Scalar /
    list-returning tools (`get_quote`, `get_quotes`, `get_accounts`,
    `get_account_numbers`, `get_transactions`, `get_orders`) were
    rewrapped in dicts; the per-tool docstrings call out the new
    shape. The `source` key in `analytics.rolling_zscore` output was
    renamed to `series_source` to avoid colliding with the envelope
    URL.

- [x] **#2 — Yahoo silent-fallback on `.info` fetch failure.**
  `yahoo/yahoo_client.py:488-490`. Exception during `_quote_payload`
  is caught and the dict left empty, so `get_quote` returns `null`
  fields instead of raising. Direct violation of AGENTS.md "no
  silent fallbacks that change the numbers" / "no fabricated
  numbers."
  - **Resolved:** `_quote_payload` now re-raises as a new
    `YahooDataError` when `ticker.info` fails, with the original
    exception chained. The tool layer (`yahoo/tools.py:99-101`,
    `126-128`) already re-raises, so the failure surfaces to the
    caller instead of being papered over with a `None`-valued
    quote. `get_quotes` aborts the batch on the first bad symbol
    rather than silently dropping it — same "say so and stop"
    posture AGENTS.md takes on rate limits.

- [x] **#3 — Yahoo silent-drop of failed option expirations.**
  `yahoo/yahoo_client.py:336-338`. When `ticker.option_chain(d)`
  raises mid-loop, the bad expiration is logged-and-`continue`'d.
  Caller gets a partial chain with no `dataQualityWarning` field
  flagging the dropped slices.
  - **Resolved:** the per-expiration loop in `get_option_chain` now
    raises `YahooDataError` on the first failed expiration with the
    original exception chained, matching the posture taken for #2's
    `_quote_payload` / `get_quotes` fix. The tool layer
    (`yahoo/tools.py:307-309`) already re-raises, so the failure
    surfaces to the caller instead of being papered over with a
    partial `callExpDateMap` / `putExpDateMap` and a misleading
    `numberOfContracts`.

- [ ] **#4 — SEC Form 4 silent-skip on parse failure.**
  `sec_edgar/tools.py:395-409`. `parse()` failures are logged and
  the filing is dropped from the response. The summary count
  silently shrinks; caller can't tell whether a CEO had no recent
  trades or whether 3/20 Form 4s failed to parse.

- [ ] **#5 — 13F value-unit boundary is off-by-month.**
  `sec_edgar/form13f_parser.py:119`. The check is
  `(year, month) >= (2022, 9)` for the "≥ 2022-09-30" cutoff. A
  filing with `period_of_report=2022-09-15` (still thousands per
  SEC) is mis-tagged as `dollars`, blowing up summed positions by
  1000×. Only finding that materially distorts numbers.

- [ ] **#6 — fed-calendar swallows layout drift.**
  `fed_calendar/fomc_scraper.py:137-152`. If federalreserve.gov
  reshapes the panels, the scraper logs a warning and returns
  `{"count": 0, "meetings": []}`. DEVELOPING.md is explicit: "Don't
  paper over with fuzzy fallbacks." Empty result needs to be a
  raise, not a warn.

## HIGH

- [ ] **#7 — OAuth token file has a permission TOCTOU window on
  first write.** `schwab/auth.py:95-101` writes the file at default
  umask, then chmods to 0600. Tokens are world-readable for the
  milliseconds in between. `schwab_client.py:528-538` does this
  correctly via `tmp + os.replace + chmod`; `auth.py` does not. Use
  the same pattern.

- [ ] **#8 — MCP server defaults: `0.0.0.0` + DNS-rebinding
  protection disabled.** `server.py:55,115-116`. The combination
  exposes the unauthenticated tool surface to any host on the
  LAN/Wi-Fi and disables Host-header validation that mitigates
  DNS-rebinding from a malicious page in the user's browser. README
  does not warn about this. Either default `--host 127.0.0.1` (and
  document `0.0.0.0` for Docker), or re-enable rebinding protection,
  or both.

- [ ] **#9 — Schwab `get_price_history` builds an invalid request
  when only one of `start_date` / `end_date` is set.**
  `schwab/schwab_client.py:156-162`. The `else: params["period"] =
  period` is in the else branch of `if start_date or end_date`, so
  passing just `start_date=...` sends `startDate` with no `endDate`
  and no `period`. Schwab rejects that combination with a terse 400.
  Either require both dates together or fall back to `period`.

- [ ] **#10 — CIK is passed `int(cik)` (zero-padding stripped) when
  building Archive URLs.** `sec_edgar/edgar_client.py:275,286`;
  `tools.py:78,263`. Inconsistent with the 10-digit normalization
  the rest of the client enforces. Works today because EDGAR's
  archive routing tolerates it; will break the day SEC tightens.

- [ ] **#11 — Finnhub clients don't distinguish 403 from generic
  4xx.** `earnings/finnhub_client.py:72-76`,
  `estimates/finnhub_client.py:67-71`. Premium endpoints return
  403; a future maintainer wiring one would see a generic
  `FinnhubError` instead of a clear "premium plan required"
  surface. Estimates' README/docstring is very firm about this —
  code should match.

- [ ] **#12 — Zero tests, zero CI.** No `tests/`, no
  `.github/workflows/`, no lint or typecheck config. For a tool
  whose purpose is "the model trusts these numbers," the parsers
  (`form4_parser`, `form13f_parser`, `fomc_scraper`,
  `french_client` CSV blocks) are the highest-value place to land
  regression tests, and currently none exist.

## MEDIUM

- [ ] **#13 — `schwab/options_summary.py` and
  `yahoo/options_summary.py` are byte-for-byte identical** (`cmp`
  confirmed). DEVELOPING.md:113-115 calls out
  `ta.py` / `analytics.py` duplication as intentional, but
  `options_summary.py` is a third duplicated file the doc doesn't
  mention, and unlike the others it isn't even tweaked at the
  docstring level. Either cite it explicitly in the duplication
  note or extract to `traider.providers._shared.options_summary`
  (no cross-provider import — both still import from `_shared`).

- [ ] **#14 — DEVELOPING.md package-layout block (~lines 51-108) is
  missing files** that exist on disk: `schwab/options_summary.py`,
  `yahoo/options_summary.py`, `fred/analytics.py`. Stale.

- [ ] **#15 — Form 4 `_bool` / `_float` silent coercion.**
  `sec_edgar/form4_parser.py:173-186`. Malformed booleans become
  `False`; malformed floats become `None`. Per AGENTS.md "no
  fabricated numbers," coercion failure should raise (or at minimum
  surface a per-row parse-warning array on the envelope).

- [ ] **#16 — `_pick_information_table` swallows 404 from
  `filing_index`.** `sec_edgar/tools.py:132-133`. The caller
  (`get_institutional_portfolio`) then reports a parser error
  instead of the real 404 / network failure.

- [ ] **#17 — fred analytics output mixes derived classifications
  with raw fields.** `fred/tools.py:161-297` and `analytics.py`.
  AGENTS.md "distinguish tool output from your inference" applies on
  the model side, but provider responses also blend derived
  `regime`, `curve_shape`, `alignment` with upstream-shaped keys.
  Either nest under `derived: {...}` or stamp the keys.

- [ ] **#18 — `auth.py` HTTP timeout 10s vs `schwab_client.py`
  30s.** `schwab/auth.py:70`. Slow-network users hit a confusing
  timeout on the most fragile path (one-shot OAuth). Align to 30.

- [ ] **#19 — Treasury monetary fields are strings — not enforced
  anywhere.** DEVELOPING.md is explicit, `treasury_client.py`
  doesn't cast, but the tool-layer doesn't assert it either. If a
  future refactor adds `float(...)` to "tidy up" the response, the
  precision-preservation guarantee is silently lost. A guard or a
  comment at the boundary would help.

- [ ] **#20 — `server.py` startup order.** `_validate_providers`
  (line 131) runs *after* `_configure_root_logging` (120) and after
  the empty-providers warn (126-129). A user with
  `TRAIDER_PROVIDERS=foo,bar` still gets log files created and the
  warning printed before the SystemExit fires. Move validation
  right after `load_settings()`.

- [ ] **#21 — `pyproject.toml` declares
  `requires-python = ">=3.11"` but DEVELOPING.md and the Dockerfile
  pin Python 3.13.** With no CI matrix, 3.11 / 3.12 are untested
  floors. Either tighten to `>=3.13` or add a test job.

## LOW

- [ ] **#22 — Stale logs in `logs/`.** `*-connector.log` files
  (root-owned, dated April 19) are from a previous logger-name
  scheme; commit f5ba823 ("Fix logger names") changed the
  convention. Files are gitignored but still on disk. Cleanup
  commit + a `.gitkeep` so the dir survives a `rm logs/*` would be
  tidier.

- [ ] **#23 — fed-calendar two-month meeting else-branch is
  identical to the if-branch.** `fed_calendar/fomc_scraper.py:188-197`.
  Works correctly; just confusing — the `else` was probably meant
  to anchor `start_dt` and `end_dt` both to `start_month` for
  single-month meetings. Either collapse the two branches or fix
  the `else` to match the comment.

- [ ] **#24 — fed-calendar `fetched_at` reflects response time, not
  scrape time.** `fed_calendar/tools.py:83,113`. Differs from
  `factor/tools.py` (which stamps the upstream fetch). Minor
  consistency bug.

- [ ] **#25 — ticker_map TTL uses `time.monotonic()` but
  `_fetched_at_iso` uses `datetime.now(...)`.**
  `sec_edgar/ticker_map.py`. Backward clock jump can put
  `fetched_at` *before* the previous fetch. Cosmetic.

- [ ] **#26 — Treasury logger name inconsistency.**
  `treasury_client.py:27` uses `"traider.treasury.fiscal"` while
  every other provider's client uses `"traider.<name>.client"` or
  just `"traider.<name>"`.

- [ ] **#27 — `__main__._run_auth` parses `sys.argv[2:]`
  positionally** — extra args are silently ignored
  (`traider auth schwab --foo` runs without complaint). Not a real
  risk; consider `argparse` for the auth subcommand for parity with
  the server one.

## Verified clean

- `.env` not tracked (gitignore + `git ls-files` checked); no
  secrets in repo.
- `compileall` on `src/` — no syntax errors.
- TokenBucket in `edgar_client.py` is correct (lock around refill,
  sleep when starved, no double-spend).
- `attach_provider_logger` is idempotent — safe to call repeatedly.
- Read-only invariant: no `POST` / `DELETE` / `PUT` to brokerage
  anywhere; auth flow only writes the local token file.
- API-key handling: keys live in env or headers, never echoed in
  responses or `logger.info(...)` calls reviewed.
- 429 propagation: every client raises rather than retry-looping.
- Schwab / Yahoo `attach_provider_logger` names match
  `settings.log_file("schwab")` / `"yahoo"`.
